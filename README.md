*The File Handling Utility project was developed as part of Task-1 during the CODTECH Internship. The aim of this project is to create a simple yet functional Java application that can perform basic file operations such as reading, writing, appending, and modifying text files. This utility demonstrates core Java concepts and helps in understanding how data can be managed and manipulated using file I/O (Input/Output) mechanisms.

The idea behind this project is very practical and relevant in the real world. Whether it’s saving logs, reading configurations, or processing text-based data, file handling is a key part of software development. For a beginner or intermediate Java programmer, mastering file handling is a vital step in becoming proficient in backend or system-level development.

At its core, the program offers a menu-driven interface where users can select one of the following four operations:

Write to a File – This allows the user to input new content, which completely overwrites the existing content in the file.

Read from a File – This displays the content of the file to the user line by line.

Append to a File – This operation adds new content at the end of the existing file without removing any previous data.

Modify Content in a File – This is a basic search and replace feature that scans the file for specific words or phrases and replaces them with the user’s input.

The main file used in the program is named example.txt, and it acts as a sample text file to demonstrate all the functionalities. Each method in the Java code is built in a modular fashion, which makes it easier to maintain and extend in the future. For instance, if you later want to add options like deleting content or formatting the text in a particular way, it can be done easily.

This project uses important Java classes from the java.io package such as File, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileWriter, FileReader, and Scanner. By using buffered streams, the program ensures efficient and smooth file reading/writing even for larger content. Exception handling is also used properly to manage any unexpected errors, such as a missing file or a permission issue, which helps make the program more robust and user-friendly.

From a learning point of view, working on this utility has helped solidify my understanding of several key Java concepts, such as:

Working with files and directories.

Handling exceptions with try-catch blocks.

Using loops and conditionals effectively.

Writing modular and reusable methods.

Taking input from the user through the console.

Beyond just writing code, this task also helped me understand how to think like a developer — identifying user needs, providing flexible options, ensuring the code handles errors gracefully, and writing clear comments for future developers to understand.

The overall user experience of the utility is designed to be friendly and interactive. It starts with a simple welcome message, followed by menu choices. Once the user selects an option, the program guides them step by step to perform the selected action. Once completed, appropriate success or error messages are shown, which makes the application feel responsive and polished.

In conclusion, this File Handling Utility might seem like a small project, but it’s incredibly valuable for anyone learning Java. It combines theory with practical application, gives confidence to handle real-world problems, and forms a strong base for future projects involving file storage, logging, data parsing, and more advanced file manipulations. For me personally, this project was a major stepping stone in my Java journey, and I’m proud to present it as part of my internship deliverable.
